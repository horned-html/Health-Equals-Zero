# Health-Equals-Zero
In most games, in order for the enemy to die, their health must be set less than or equal to zero (which disallows negative health values).
What if instead the health had to be EXACTLY zero instead? What if the only way to kill an enemy was to HEAL them? That would be wacky wouldn't it?
